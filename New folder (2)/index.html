								<h3>Restrictions imposed before judgement</h3>
								<p>For 15 days preceding the verdict, restrictions were imposed in Ayodhya to prevent violence. Security arrangements were increased across India. Thousands of paramilitary forces and police troops were deployed in Ayodhya and surveillance of the region was carried out using CCTV cameras and drones. 
									Internet services were closed in several places in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, while it was announced that a total of 31 districts and 673 individuals were being closely monitored. Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of India was invoked in the entire state of Uttar Pradesh as well as in some major cities such as Bangalore, Bhopal, Jaipur, Lucknow, and Mumbai. A public holiday was declared for schools and colleges across the states of Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, as well as Delhi, on the day of the verdict. Security was stepped up across various towns in Telangana; 20,000 personnel deployed in Hyderabad, mainly around the communally sensitive areas of the Old City including the Charminar and Mecca Masjid. According to reports, around 40,000 police personnel were deployed in Mumbai and 15,000 in Chennai as a precautionary measure. The prime minister made a public request for maintaining peace and religious harmony.
